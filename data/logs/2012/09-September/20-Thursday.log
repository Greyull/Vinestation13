[03:00:03]OOC: Elswood Vasilyev/Metasight : get the liberty cap seeds
[03:00:14]OOC: Slipshod/Slipshod : i couldn&#39;t get a tool for it
[03:00:25]OOC: Slipshod/Slipshod : and most people i asked didn&#39;t know where one was
[03:00:29]OOC: Elswood Vasilyev/Metasight : Your new objective as a botanist is to grow walking mushrooms and liberty caps
[03:00:30]OOC: Hyenic/Hyenic : I read special seeds, and I think something completely different.
[03:00:52]OOC: CiksKayVolts/CiksKayVolts : What are the easy and essential roles, anyway?
[03:01:02]OOC: Slipshod/Slipshod : i tried injecting some pod plant seeds with blood
[03:01:23]OOC: Slipshod/Slipshod : but nothing would grow out of them, even after i harvested a bunch of seeds to experiment with
[03:01:30]OOC: Proboscis/Proboscis : Easy roles are generally considered to be Bartender, Assistant, Janitor and Botanist.
[03:01:37]OOC: Proboscis/Proboscis : That&#39;s why we had a fucking BILLION of those.
[03:01:43]OOC: RevScarecrow/RevScarecrow : would you like help with that probo
[03:02:02]OOC: Proboscis/Proboscis : Help with what?
[03:02:05]OOC: Slipshod/Slipshod : my role as assistant always goes to being a victim dragged off and beaten to death
[03:02:08]OOC: RevScarecrow/RevScarecrow : I might try something different but if you need a classs
[03:02:15]OOC: CiksKayVolts/CiksKayVolts : I started as Shaft Miner after being a useless assistant one time
[03:02:36]OOC: RevScarecrow/RevScarecrow : but i can be a botanist if you want
[03:02:36]OOC: Libertyprime/Libertyprime : what does shaft miner do?
[03:02:36]OOC: Proboscis/Proboscis : Oh, just play whatever, dude. We&#39;re probably going to be switching gamemode when an admin comes around anyway.
[03:02:50]OOC: CiksKayVolts/CiksKayVolts : Mine ores and smelt them
[03:02:54]OOC: Slipshod/Slipshod : aye, if one does come about hehe
[03:03:01]OOC: Proboscis/Proboscis : I can only really suggest waiting a few seconds for everyone to pick and then filling gaps.
[03:03:05]OOC: Hyenic/Hyenic :  Hm. Gmae. Y u no start
[03:03:13]OOC: Hyenic/Hyenic : Oh gosh I can&#39;t type tonight
[03:03:28]OOC: Libertyprime/Libertyprime : where do you mine ores?
[03:03:32]OOC: Slipshod/Slipshod : hehe, i stole a monkey to have as a pet in the botany lab
[03:03:38]OOC: RevScarecrow/RevScarecrow : somewhere in space i think
[03:03:49]OOC: Slipshod/Slipshod : there&#39;s a shuttle for an away mission iirc
[03:03:53]OOC: Proboscis/Proboscis : You go to the mining dock and use the shuttle to get to the mining asteroid.
[03:03:58]OOC: Proboscis/Proboscis : Then you suit up and get outside.
[03:04:06]OOC: Southboundslunk/Southboundslunk : Hold on, can I not join as a &#39;borg?
[03:04:06]OOC: CiksKayVolts/CiksKayVolts : There&#39;s a mining station

[03:04:46]OOC: Elswood Vasilyev/Metasight : I think next round I play geneticist I&#39;m going to scan everyone in the station, then clone everyone
[03:04:57]OOC: Hyenic/Hyenic : I want to be a wizard.
[03:05:05]OOC: Proboscis/Proboscis : Meta, you can only clone people who are dead.
[03:05:09]OOC: RevScarecrow/RevScarecrow : i think im gonna try cargo so i can figure out why i never get things
[03:05:16]OOC: Elswood Vasilyev/Metasight : Don&#39;t worry I can kill them :)
[03:05:24]OOC: Proboscis/Proboscis : Alright. I&#39;ll probably be a quartermaster as per usual.
[03:05:40]OOC: Slipshod/Slipshod : hmm, well we have 11 people, but maybe what, 6 or 7 present?
[03:05:41]OOC: CiksKayVolts/CiksKayVolts : Also, where do I send the refined ores?
[03:05:51]OOC: Southboundslunk/Southboundslunk : Maybe I could send a message onto Vinechat for more people?
[03:06:09]OOC: Libertyprime/Libertyprime : yeh
[03:06:11]OOC: Proboscis/Proboscis : You refine them, then ship them back to the station via material boxes, I believe?
[03:06:12]OOC: Slipshod/Slipshod : i wouldn&#39;t advertise....but....
[03:06:26]OOC: Slipshod/Slipshod : maybe you could off the collar mention you are going to go play SS13
[03:06:30]OOC: Proboscis/Proboscis : Slunky, if you message vinechat, we&#39;ll just have the same problem as last time
[03:06:33]OOC: Hyenic/Hyenic : I require a carbonated beverage, so i&#39;ll brb
[03:06:44]OOC: Proboscis/Proboscis : We had four cultists who absolutely didn&#39;t know how to cultist.
[03:06:45]OOC: CiksKayVolts/CiksKayVolts : Okay. The farthest I got as a shaft miner is refining them, so...
[03:06:52]OOC: Proboscis/Proboscis : At the end, three died and one was just doing his job.
[03:06:56]OOC: Slipshod/Slipshod : i was one of those you know
[03:07:02]OOC: Slipshod/Slipshod : in an earlier round
[03:07:14]OOC: Proboscis/Proboscis : We went from 43 people to 18.
[03:07:16]OOC: Slipshod/Slipshod : i used the cultist contact dealy and nobody would respond

[03:09:14]OOC: CiksKayVolts/CiksKayVolts : And then we can... you know... use our mining drills on each other...
[03:09:17]OOC: Proboscis/Proboscis : Mining just has a little bit of hauling.

[03:11:59]OOC: CiksKayVolts/CiksKayVolts : Yeah, I&#39;ll probably do cargo tech later on, and then take up quatermaster once I get better at this game
[03:12:00]OOC: Hyenic/Hyenic : to buckle into chairs, you drag your person onto the chair
[03:12:08]OOC: Proboscis/Proboscis : Nuh-uh, nigger.

[11:21:31]SAY: Jennifer Clarke/MentalJen : What is the &#34;cover lock?&#34;
[11:21:48]SAY: Kirbachev Ramos/Kirbachev : The cover lock, you need to disengage that actually.

[11:22:03]SAY: Kirbachev Ramos/Kirbachev : Whoops.
[11:22:17]SAY: Jennifer Clarke/MentalJen : I locked it myself so I just unlocked it. Lemme get a crowbar if I don&#39;t have one.

[11:22:59]SAY: Kirbachev Ramos/Kirbachev : A crowbar, wrench, screwdriver, and analyser should be among the things on your toolbelt.

[11:23:09]SAY: Jennifer Clarke/MentalJen : I feel that I am sufficiently equipped now to some extent.
[11:23:22]SAY: Jennifer Clarke/MentalJen : Do I just.. hit it with the crowbar passively?
[11:23:26]SAY: Kirbachev Ramos/Kirbachev : Yep.
[11:23:42]SAY: Kirbachev Ramos/Kirbachev : That&#39;s the battery you can see, a high-power energy cell.
[11:23:56]SAY: Jennifer Clarke/MentalJen : I removed it and put it back.
[11:24:07]SAY: Kirbachev Ramos/Kirbachev : That&#39;s how you replace those cells. They charge up off the main power grid and then redistribute excess power.
[11:24:25]SAY: Jennifer Clarke/MentalJen : Where can I find extra cells if I need one?
[11:24:27]SAY: Kirbachev Ramos/Kirbachev : So when power fails, they&#39;ll carry along until their stored charge goes dry.
[11:24:43]SAY: Kirbachev Ramos/Kirbachev : They&#39;re scattered around the station, usually in storage areas.
[11:25:11]SAY: Kirbachev Ramos/Kirbachev : We have a few here in engineering, and there&#39;s a cell recharger on the table just across the room, next to that yellow toolbox.

[11:29:54]SAY: Kirbachev Ramos/Kirbachev : And the cover lock couldn&#39;t be engaged because you swiped it with your card first.
[11:30:14]SAY: Kirbachev Ramos/Kirbachev : You have to configure the smes and angling, Cake.
[11:30:27]SAY: Kirbachev Ramos/Kirbachev : set the SMES to 80k input, and 0 output.
[11:30:28]SAY: mouse/ : SQUEEK!
[11:30:51]SAY: Kirbachev Ramos/Kirbachev : Then go onto the alignment computer, set it to Timed, then back to Auto.
[11:31:02]SAY: Cake Comradius/CakeComrade : Whats the SMES
[11:31:08]SAY: Kirbachev Ramos/Kirbachev : MAKE SURE to leave the output at zero. It needs to charge for a bit first.
[11:31:08]SAY: Jennifer Clarke/MentalJen : I will be right back.
[11:31:16]SAY: Kirbachev Ramos/Kirbachev : Alright Jen.
[11:31:54]SAY: Kirbachev Ramos/Kirbachev : Check back on it in a while, the charge should ideally be about 30% before you set the output. When you do, set it to around 50k.
[11:31:54]SAY: Cake Comradius/CakeComrade : Nevermind, got it
[11:32:25]SAY: Jennifer Clarke/MentalJen : I noticed that you are wearing an entirely different outfit than me.
[11:32:28]SAY: Kirbachev Ramos/Kirbachev : Alright, so that&#39;s how you work with the APC units.
[11:32:38]SAY: Kirbachev Ramos/Kirbachev : Yeah, a hardsuit.
[11:32:40]SAY: Jennifer Clarke/MentalJen : Thank you for teaching me about that.
[11:32:46]SAY: Jennifer Clarke/MentalJen : Can you go into space with that suit on?
[11:32:58]SAY: Kirbachev Ramos/Kirbachev : Don&#39;t into vacuum without either a hardsuit or a space suit.
[11:33:36]SAY: Jennifer Clarke/MentalJen : I also noticed that  I believe the clown has stolen some of our lockers.
[11:33:37]SAY: Kirbachev Ramos/Kirbachev : That should be the only APC you really need to fiddle with, unless someone starts stealing the batteries out of APCs around the station.

[11:34:13]SAY: Cake Comradius/CakeComrade : oh, nevermind
[11:34:19]SAY: Kirbachev Ramos/Kirbachev : Probably because the APC is out of juice, Cake.
[11:34:36]SAY: Kirbachev Ramos/Kirbachev : There&#39;s a couple around engineering. Failing that, there&#39;s the EVA suits.
